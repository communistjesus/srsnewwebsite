This is pretty much all you need to see to get started

## Headings

Creating heading size 1 like this:

`# Heading 1`

# Heading 1

As you see, heading 1 won't do what you think! Generally no reason to use it.

Creating heading size 2 like this:

`## Heading 2`

## Heading 2

Creating heading size 3 like this:

`### Heading 3`

### Heading 3

Creating heading size 4 like this:

`#### Heading 4`

#### Heading 4

Creating heading size 5 like this:
`##### Heading 5`

##### Heading 5

Creating heading size 6 like this:

`###### Heading 6`

###### Heading 6

## Inline

Bold text with `**` around it:

`**like so**`

**like so**

Italicize text with `*` around it:

`*like so*`

*like so*

Add horizontal rules like so:

`---`

---

Add strikethrough like so:

`~~like so~~`

~~like so~~

Inline code blocks:

\`like so\`

`like so`

Cite sources inline like so

`like so[^1]`

like so[^1]

## Images and Links

Images are a bit funky to resize in markdown, so try to use images that are already the correct size. Image sizes are capped to 50% of page size and centered. Text does not wrap images.

Like so:

`![Eagle of Saladin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Eagle_of_Saladin_blank.svg)` 

`*Eagle of Saladin Caption*`

![Eagle of Saladin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Eagle_of_Saladin_blank.svg) 

*Eagle of Saladin Caption*

Make sure the caption is right after the image for it to display properly! Captions are good style but otherwise optional.

Links like so:

`[Jerusalem on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem)`

[Jerusalem on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem)

## Quotes and Highlights (and Code)

Blockquote like so:

`> Democracy for an insignificant minority, democracy for the rich--that is thedemocracy of capitalist society. If we look more closely into the machinery ofcapitalist democracy, we see everywhere, in the “petty”--supposedly petty--details ofthe suffrage (residential qualifications, exclusion of women, etc.), in the technique ofthe representative institutions, in the actual obstacles to the right of assembly (publicbuildings are not for “paupers”!), in the purely capitalist organization of the dailypress, etc., etc.,--we see restriction after restriction upon democracy. Theserestrictions, exceptions, exclusions, obstacles for the poor seem slight, especially inthe eyes of one who has never known want himself and has never been inclose contactwith the oppressed classes in their mass life (and nine out of 10, if not 99 out of 100,bourgeois publicists and politicians come under this category); but in their sum totalthese restrictions exclude and squeeze out the poor from politics, from activeparticipation in democracy.` 
`*Lenin, State and Revolution*`

*Lenin, State and Revolution*

Notice we can caption blockquotes. Make sure to put a single line between caption and blockquote for correct styling. Otherwise blockquote captions are optional.

Highlight blocks like so:

\{\% highlight() \%\}

Look a little funky? Luckily this is the last funky one.

## Lists and Task Lists

Bullet lists like so:

`- like`

`- so`

- like
- so

Ordered lists like so:

`1. like`

`2. so`

1. like
2. so

Task lisks like so:

`- [x] like`

`- [] so`

- [x] like
- [] so

All of these can be nested.

Nest lists like so:

`- first`

&nbsp;&nbsp;`- like`

&nbsp;&nbsp;`- so`

- first
  - like
  - so

## Table

Like so:

`| Like | So |`

`| ----------- | ----------- |`

`| 1 | 2 |`

`| 3 | 4 |`

| Like | So |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 | 

## Other

Escape otherwise 'useful' characters with a backslash `\`, for example: 

`\#`

\#

## I want to do x

These likely meet everything you will reasonably use on SquareSpace.

If there is something you really want to do, but cannot, reach out to E. Things are usually very simple to add.
